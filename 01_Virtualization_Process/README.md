# Weâ€™ll now explore some of the other flags. One important flag is -S, which determines how the system reacts when a process issues an I/O. With the flag set to SWITCH_ON_END, the system will NOT switch to another process while one is doing I/O, instead of waiting until the process is completely finished. What happens when you run the following two processes (-l 1:0,4:100 -c -S SWITCH_ON_END), one doing I/O and the other doing CPU work?
